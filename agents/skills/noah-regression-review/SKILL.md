# Noah Regression Review

Use this skill for code review, self-review before completion, or when a task is risky enough that side effects must be traced explicitly.

## Review priority

Look for:

1. broken architecture boundaries
2. auth or permission regressions
3. FE/API contract mismatches
4. missing mapper or model updates
5. registration or boot omissions
6. stale cache, realtime, search, or job side effects
7. missing tests or unverified flows

## Review method

Trace the affected flow end-to-end:

- entry point
- route registration
- handler/controller
- service/use-case
- repository/query
- DTO/model/mapper
- UI consumer

Do not stop at the file that changed if downstream assumptions are obvious.

## High-risk trigger list

- new or changed route paths
- permission changes
- payload shape changes
- status or enum changes
- schema/migration changes
- feature registration changes
- new background jobs or cron registrations
- cache, websocket, pubsub, metadata, or search integrations

## Output rules

When findings exist, report concrete issues first, ordered by severity, with file and line references.

If no findings are discovered:

- say so explicitly
- mention residual risks
- mention what was not verified

## Minimum verification checklist

- affected route/handler registration still works
- frontend route metadata still matches navigation expectations
- mapper/model updates are complete
- permissions are preserved
- changed mutations do not leave stale reads behind
- nearby tests were updated or the missing coverage was called out

## Avoid

- review summaries that only restate the diff
- approving contract or permission changes without tracing both sides
- assuming hidden pages, comments, or UI affordances enforce backend safety
